            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Hey there! We’re four college sophomores from the University of Louisville, and just like a lot of students, we’ve struggled with the big question—what do we want to do with our lives? Figuring out a career path wasn’t easy, and we wished there was a better way to explore our options. One path that doesn’t always get enough attention is trade school. There are so many rewarding careers out there that don’t require a traditional four-year degree—careers that offer stability, great pay, and real hands-on work. We want to shine a light on these opportunities and give students the tools they need to find the right fit. Whether you’re still figuring things out or ready to dive into a career, we’re here to help!</p>

                <p>A trade school is a place where you can learn hands-on skills for a specific job, like becoming an electrician, mechanic, or medical assistant. Instead of spending four years in college studying a little bit of everything, you dive straight into the skills you actually need for your career. Most programs take months instead of years, so you can start working (and earning) faster. Many trade schools work with real businesses, helping students find internships, apprenticeships, and even full-time jobs after graduation. </p>
